I am Jiale Guo, a Research Assistant(ra) at the\r\n            Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources,\r\n            Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIEER, CAS www.nieer.cas.cn).\r\n            My research interests are very broad and include both\r\n            Geospatial artificial intelligence (Geo-AI), X-AI,\r\n            GIScience, Geospatial statistics and Geospatial-temporal\r\n            analysis, as well as Hydrometeorology, Flash Drought, Snow\r\n            Drought, hydrological model et.al. You might be wondering\r\n            why I have such diverse research interests. It is well known\r\n            that until the 1960s, much of the study done by geographers\r\n            was qualitative in nature, necessitating a clear\r\n            differentiation between one being a physical geographer and\r\n            the other. However, the metrological geography revolution\r\n            occurred, allowing geography to be studied scientifically\r\n            and numerically despite its descriptive legacy. According to\r\n            me, the age of the explosion of big data in geography has\r\n            begun as a result of the ongoing development of earth\r\n            observation technology. There is now both a wealth of\r\n            quantitative analysis tools and a vast amount of\r\n            geographical data available as input to geographic research.\r\n            I do not confine myself to physical geography, human\r\n            geography, or geoinformatics because of this; instead, I\r\n            concentrate more on the methodological components of\r\n            geography. Combining geographic approaches and data-driven\r\n            solutions to contemporary geospatial difficulties is a\r\n            particularly intriguing topic since spatial position\r\n            variables are a crucial component of all sorts of geographic\r\n            data. This is why I prefer the term “spatial data scientist”\r\n            to be used. So you can call me a spatial data scientist.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Education\r\n            Bachelor of Science, Geographical\r\n            Science, | Chuzhou University, China 2017-2021\r\n            Specialization: Land Management\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Honors\r\n            Graduates with excellent academic performance in colleges and universities in Anhui Province, (1/57)        Jun 2021\r\nNational Encouragement scholarship, Education Department of Anhui Province, (1/57)                                  Oct 2020\r\nAcademic Excellence Scholarship (First-class) of Chuzhou University, (1/57)                                         Oct 2020\r\nAcademic Excellence Scholarship (Third-class)) of Chuzhou University, (8/57)                                        Oct 2019\r\nAcademic Excellence Scholarship (Third-class) of Chuzhou University, (3/57)                                           Oct 2018\r\nExcellent Student Leader of Chuzhou University, three times in 2018&2019&2020     \r\nAward ¥5000 grant of \"Internet +\" University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition              Oct 2020\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Experience\r\n            Google Brain | Principal Investigator |\r\n            January 2018 - Present\r\n            Netflix | Research Scientist | June 2014\r\n            - December 2017\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Jiale Guo\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              About Me\r\n              Hi!
